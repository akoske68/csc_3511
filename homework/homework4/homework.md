# CSC3511 Security and Network - Week 4 Homework

**Topic:** DNS\
*(You may find it helpful to consult the DNS specifications, RFC 1034
and RFC 1035)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DNS Query Tools: nslookup vs dig

### nslookup

**Pros:** - Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux by default\
- Simple syntax; interactive mode available

**Cons:** - Limited output formatting\
- Some consider it deprecated (though still widely used)\
- Less flexible than dig

### dig (Domain Information Groper)

**Pros:** - More detailed output\
- Better for scripting\
- More flexible query options\
- Preferred by network professionals

**Cons:** - Not installed by default on Windows\
- Slightly more complex syntax

> For this homework, we'll use **nslookup**, but you are encouraged to
> explore **dig** as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic DNS Lookup

Open a command prompt and type:

``` bash
nslookup www.google.com
```

**Notes:**

1.  `nslookup` is used to query DNS servers for domain names and IP
    addresses.
2.  Running it without arguments enters *interactive mode*. Type `exit`
    to leave.

### Questions

1.  How many IP addresses do you see?
    - 3 IP addresses:
      - One DNS server `10.200.0.29`
      - One IPv4 `142.250.190.132`
      - One IPv6 \`2607:f8b0:4009:814::2004
2.  What similarities and differences do you notice between them?
    - The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are for the same URI `www.google.com`.
    - The IP address `10.200.0.29` is for MSOE's local DNS server.
3.  What server services your reply (first line of the response)? Why
    might this be?
    - MSOE's DNS server services the reply, as it has a cache of
      Google's server address.
4.  Does your response say *"Non-authoritative answer"*? Why might this
    occur?
    - Yes, it does. It means that the response is not from an
      authoritative server, but rather the DNS server's cache.

## Wireshark Network Analysis

Follow the steps below and answer Questions **5.1 -- 5.3.**

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Install and Launch Wireshark**

    - [Download Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
    - Run as administrator (Windows)

2.  **Select Network Interface**

    - Choose your active network (usually WiFi) and start capture

3.  **Apply DNS Filter**

    - Enter `dns` in the filter bar and press Enter

4.  **Capture DNS Traffic**

    - With Wireshark running, run:

      ``` bash
      nslookup www.google.com
      ```

    - Stop capture after a few seconds

5.  **Analyze DNS Packets**

    - Expand **Domain Name System (query)** and **(response)** sections
      \### Questions

5.1. Can you find the IP addresses in the response packets? - Yes, there
are 2 response packets (one for IPv4 and one for IPv6). For each
response packet, the IP is located within the Answers section.
![image](dns_response.png "DNS Response")

5.2. How are they encoded in the DNS packet structure? - IP addresses
are encoded in bytes (hexadecimal digits) in the response data
![image](ip_encoding.png "IP Encoding")

5.3. What other information do you see in the DNS packets? - We can also
see information like the DNS record type, class, tile to live, length of
data (in bytes) and additional flags.

> **Privacy Note:** Only capture traffic on networks you own or have
> permission to monitor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mail Query

### DNS Record Types

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Record Type Description
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  **A**       Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address

  **MX**      Mail Exchange record; specifies mail servers + priority

  **CNAME**   Alias from one domain name to another

  **PTR**     Used for reverse DNS lookups (IP â†’ domain name)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### MX Query Exercise

Run:

``` bash
nslookup -q=MX mit.edu
```

Example output:

    mit.edu mail exchanger = 10 mail.mit.edu
    mit.edu mail exchanger = 20 backup-mail.mit.edu

**Questions**

6.  What is the name of the mail server with the lowest priority number?

- `mail.mit.edu`

7.  What server services your reply?
    - The cache of MSOE'S DNS server `10.200.0.29`
8.  Does your response say *"Non-authoritative answer"*? Why might this
    occur?
    - Yes. This occurs as MSOE'S DNS server has a cache of the record.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hierarchical Authoritative Lookup

Run:

``` bash
nslookup www.msoe.edu a.root-servers.net
```

You should see:

    Name: <domain>
    Served by:
    - d.gtld-servers.net
      192.31.80.30
      net

**Questions**

9.  What domain name do you get while looking up the mail server?

    - Primary Name Server: `ddi-ha.msoe.edu`
    - Responsible Mail Addr: `root.mx.msoe.edu`
      ![image](msoe_mail.png "IP Encoding")

10. Fill in the table as you move through the DNS hierarchy:

      Domain Name Server Doma   in Served IP     Address
      ------------------------- -------------- -----------
      a.root-servers.net (roo   t\) 19          8.41.0.4
      a.edu-servers.net edu     19              2.5.6.30
      1-05.azure-dns.com msoe   .edu 13.        107.236.5

11. Explain why the root server doesn't directly return the IP for
    [www.msoe.edu](http://www.msoe.edu).

    - The root server doesn't return the IP for www.msoe.edu because it
      doesn't store specific domain records.

- What does it return instead?
  - The root server instead returns a list of .edu TLD name servers that
    will have the records for .edu domains.
- Why is DNS designed this way?
  - To distribute load and allow scalability
- What are the advantages of this hierarchical approach?
  - ## Scalability, reduced load, and allow for faster query times

## Wireshark Sniffing

Run:

``` bash
nslookup www.nytimes.com
```

**Question:** Roughly how many query packets do you see (not counting
responses)? - There are 7 query packets

Then run:

``` bash
nslookup -nosearch -q=A www.nytimes.com
```

12. How many query packets do you see now?
    - There are 2 query packets

- The `-nosearch` and `-q=A` options should reduce the number of packets
  sent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time To Live (TTL)

Run:

``` bash
nslookup -d2 -nosearch -q=a www.msoe.edu
```

If that doesn't work, try:

``` bash
nslookup -debug www.msoe.edu
```

13. What is the TTL for the message?
    - 86400 (24 hours)

- How does it change between runs?
  - It decreases as time passes between runs until the record expires
    and must be refreshed from the authoritative server.
- What units are used?
  - Seconds

Now query the authoritative server:

``` bash
nslookup -d2 -nosearch -q=a www.msoe.edu <authoritative-name-server>
```

14. What is the TTL for this message?
    - 86400 seconds (24 hours)

    - How does it change between runs?

      - It does not decrease as it reports the original TTL value since
        it is the source of truth for the record.

    - Why does the authoritative server behave differently?

      - ## The authoritative server returns the full TTL because its the original source of the DNS record, not a cached copy on the MSOE DNS server.

## PTR Lookup

15. Use:

``` bash
nslookup -q=PTR 64.182.211.4
```

- What is the domain name for this IP?
  - `www.northpole.com`
- Where is the company located?
  - ## The website is hosted in a data center in Dallas, Texas (Gotten from [here](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/64.182.211.4). Not sure what else you were asking for.)

## CNAME Lookup

16. Use:

``` bash
nslookup -q=CNAME www.nytimes.com
```

17. Then, perform a PTR lookup on the resulting IP address.

    ![image](reverse.png "PTR Response")

- Why is the result not the same domain?
  - There is no resultant PTR record for the IP returned by the nslookup
    of nytimes's CNAME address.
